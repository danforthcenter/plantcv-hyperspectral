# Code Of Conduct

## Summary

Harassment in code and discussion or violation of physical boundaries is
completely unacceptable anywhere in the PlantCV project codebase, issue
tracker, chatrooms, mailing lists, meetups, and other events. Violators
will be warned by the core team. Repeat violations will result in being
blocked or banned by the core team at or before the 3rd violation.

## In detail

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender 
identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical
appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images, deliberate 
intimidation, stalking, sustained disruption, and unwelcome sexual 
attention.

Individuals asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Maintainers are also subject to the anti-harassment policy.

If anyone engages in harassing behavior, including maintainers, we may 
take appropriate action, up to and including warning the offender, 
deletion of comments, removal from the project’s codebase and 
communication systems, and escalation to GitHub support.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, 
or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the core team immediately.

We expect everyone to follow these rules anywhere in the PlantCV project
codebase, issue tracker, chatrooms, mailing lists, meetups, and other events.

Finally, don't forget that it is human to make mistakes! We all do. 
Let’s work together to help each other, resolve issues, and learn from 
the mistakes that we will all inevitably make from time to time.
